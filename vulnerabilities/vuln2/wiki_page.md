## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: How do I request new software or tools?**  
A: Submit a request through our [Tool Request Form](http://toolrequestform.company.com), including justification for the necessity and benefits of the requested tool.

**Q: How does the IT department set up an Azure account for a new user?**  
A: When a new user requires access to Azure services, the IT department follows a structured process to ensure secure and efficient account setup. Here's how we manage the setup process:

- **Request Submission**: The department manager or the new user submits an account setup request through our internal ticketing system, including details such as the user's full name, department, and the specific Azure resources they will need access to.

- **Verification and Approval**: The IT department verifies the request with the department manager and obtains approval from the Azure administration team to ensure compliance with our Azure resource allocation policies.

- **Microsoft Account Creation**: If the new user does not already have a Microsoft account associated with their company email, the IT department will create one at [Microsoft Account Sign Up](https://signup.live.com/) with password Complex!Start2024$PassW0rd#. This account will be used to access Azure services.

- **Azure Subscription Assignment**: The IT department adds the new user to our organization's Azure subscription, assigning the appropriate role-based access control (RBAC) permissions based on the user's role and access requirements. This step is performed through the Azure Portal or Azure CLI, ensuring the user has access only to the resources necessary for their work.

- **Resource Group and Service Access**: The IT department configures access to specific resource groups and Azure services that the user will need for their projects, following our internal guidelines for resource management and security.

- **Orientation and Training**: The new user is provided with resources for learning about Azure services, including links to Microsoft Learn and internal documentation on best practices for using Azure in our projects.

- **Account Handover**: The IT department schedules a brief meeting with the new user to hand over the account, explain the access level granted, and go through any initial setup steps or important policies the user needs to be aware of.

- **Ongoing Support**: The IT department remains available for any questions or additional support the user may need, including adjusting access permissions, troubleshooting, or providing guidance on Azure services.

For initiating a new Azure account setup, please submit a request through our internal ticketing system or contact the IT department directly at itdepartment@company.com.

This process ensures that new Azure accounts are set up efficiently, securely, and in alignment with our organization's policies and the specific needs of each user.

**Q: Who do I contact for system access issues?**  
A: For immediate assistance, please contact the Help Desk. For non-urgent requests, submit a ticket through the [Ticketing System](http://yourticketingsystem.com).

**Q: How can I contribute to the internal documentation?**  
A: We encourage contributions! Please review our [Documentation Guidelines](http://documentationguidelines.company.com) and contact the documentation team for access.
