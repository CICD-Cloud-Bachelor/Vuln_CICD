# VULN1 Project Documentation

## Introduction
The VULN1 project is a comprehensive initiative within our organization aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of our continuous integration and deployment pipeline. This documentation provides a detailed overview of the project setup, repositories, pipelines, and permissions. It is designed for developers and new team members to understand our DevOps practices and architectural decisions.

## Project Configuration

### Repository Overview
The VULN1 repository hosts the primary codebase for our application. It includes all necessary configuration files, source code, and scripts needed for deployment and testing. Developers are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the repository structure and contribute according to the project guidelines.

### Pipeline Configuration
The `BUILD_PIPELINE` is central to our CI/CD approach, automating the build, test, and deployment phases. Configured to trigger on each commit, it ensures that changes are automatically built and tested, maintaining high code quality and deployment readiness.

**Pipeline Features**:
- Automated Builds on commit
- Integration and unit testing
- Deployment to staging and production environments

### Secrets Management
Sensitive data, such as API keys and database credentials, are managed securely using Azure DevOps secrets. These secrets are injected into the pipeline at runtime and are not exposed in the build logs or the repository.

## Development Practices

### Code Reviews
All code changes are required to undergo a review process before merging. This practice ensures that at least two team members review changes, promoting high code standards and reducing potential errors.

### Branching Strategy
We use the Git Flow branching strategy:
- **Feature branches**: For new features and non-emergency bug fixes.
- **Release branches**: For preparing releases.
- **Hotfix branches**: For immediate fixes in production.

### Version Control
Proper commit messages and descriptions are imperative for maintaining a clear history. Commits must clearly describe the implemented changes and the reasons for these changes.

## User Permissions

### Access Controls
- **Developers**:
  - Generic Read: Allow
  - Generic Write: Allow
  - View Builds: Allow
  - View Build Definition: Allow

### Administrative Permissions
Project administrators have full control over the project settings, including the management of user roles and permissions. It is crucial to maintain strict control over administrative accesses to prevent unauthorized changes.

## Conclusion
The VULN1 project represents a critical component of our software development lifecycle. Adhering to the outlined practices and configurations will ensure smooth operations and high standards of code quality and security. This documentation should serve as a living document, updated regularly as the project evolves and new practices are adopted.
